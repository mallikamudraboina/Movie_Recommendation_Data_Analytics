Movies	Extracted release year, cleaned genres	Regex + Pandas
Users	Cleaned age, gender, occupation values	Pandas
Combined Data	Joined tables, fixed missing IDs	Validation
•	Null values handled
•	Duplicates removed
•	Datatypes standardized
2. EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)
Performed analysis on:
•	Rating distribution
•	Genre frequency
•	User demographics
•	Movie popularity
•	Time-based rating trends
